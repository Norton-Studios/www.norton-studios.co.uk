Agree standards and align on ways of working
We would seek to agree development standards and ways of working. The emphasis would be on the adoption of the existing coding standards and processes that have already been established. Areas that we would align on include:
Coding standards
Documentation standards and process
Agree testing and release standards and processes
Branching strategy
User story and defect tickets

Agree scope and identify dependencies, and areas of overlap
Work with the existing team and use domain driven design techniques to establish the areas of the codebase that our team would be contributing to. In order to minimise the chances of multiple teams needing to work on exactly the same areas of code:
Use of APIs (and potentially microservices) to establish clear contracts with other areas of code and work on self contained functionality within a bounded context.
The designation of ‘Repo champions’ who are responsible for governing particular areas of code.

Communicate early, communicate often
Good communication is critical to working effectively with multiple scrum teams. We use the following communication methods to communicate in a frictionless and effective manner.
Making our sprint ceremonies (stand-ups, sprint planning etc) backlogs and decision making open to everyone. Focus on show and tells and demos.
Presenting ‘technical spikes’ early at the design stage and taking input from the larger team
Publish good documentation, use internal blogs for significant new developments
Dedicated travis release and issue channels that all teams can monitor
Automatic alerts generated from the pipeline to slack channels
Visibly marking out the team making a release

Invest in automated integration and testing
We are advocates of automated testing and continuous deployment.  By investing in a strong DevOps pipeline, the team is more likely to integrate more often and identify any issues earlier. Other areas that we focus on include:
Comprehensive unit testing allowing us to pivot and refactor more quickly if changes are required.
Building test stubs for other teams so that their development is not held up by our team.
Deliver small Git commits and pull-requests.
Testing our integration with the other teams by delivering a small release through the full life-cycle as early as possible.

Understanding and engagement with the stakeholders
We start all projects by gaining a deep understanding of the stakeholders and their motivations. This early analysis forms our engagement plan for the stakeholders, highlighting the groups that would need more attention and informing the frequency and nature of communication.

On the HMCTS Reform Programme we had an extremely complex stakeholder landscape ranging from members of the public, court staff, other government departments and the Judiciary.
We worked to understand the motivations and concerns of all groups and developed an engagement plan for each. The Judiciary were identified as a critical group, but also highly fragmented and diverse. We formed a 6 judge working group to inform on features and benefits and make difficult prioritisation calls. The group jointly owned the decisions and presented back to the leadership team. In addition to group meetings we encouraged the team to spend time working individually with the judges, getting a real understanding for the practicalities of their job and concerns about the programme.

Value, Benefit and Prioritisation
When validating the value and strategic benefit of ideas and making priority calls, we would typically increase engagement. Our goal is to minimise surprises for stakeholders and to be completely transparent about the project. Decisions should be shared.
When allocating value to a particular feature, we have found that a detailed or scientific approach can often be misleading. We have had better success with a simpler points-based system making an evaluation of high/medium/low technical complexity, cost savings, strategic benefit etc.
We aim to remove the emotion from the prioritisation process, use all the data that is available (and get more data if possible or required) and involve stakeholders in the decisions. We have to ensure that all understand the limits of resources or time. On the recent Civil Money Claims projects for HMCTS we worked with a group of corporate ‘Bulk’ professional users.  Bulk users account for over 1m cases a year, however, with a bit of analysis we could target 10 representative organisations that jointly represented 75% of all users.
It is the job of our analytics, user research and technical teams to facilitate discussions and provide the necessary data to assist product lead decision making.

User insight
Our approach to user insight starts with having a clear hypothesis, a plan to test it and a mechanism for a frank and open review of the results. User insight can be costly, it is therefore important to constantly ask the question ‘Are we learning anything new?’ to ensure we are not wasting money or asking the wrong questions.  In our experience, when a product is in beta stage, the ongoing cost of analytics data is relatively low but insight can be invaluable. User research in its many forms can be more difficult to evaluate. We have found that we can gain a surprising amount of insight from a relatively small number of user research participants, and we may well have access to free test subjects through the client and friends and family.

Business need
We work with the client team and wider stakeholders to gain an understanding of the business need from the outset. We prompt our team to keep validating that we truly have a clear and shared understanding of the problem to be solved. Furthermore we understand the desired outcome and how this contributes to the strategic goals.

Technical Complexity
We encourage the involvement of an experienced technical solution architect in all projects as part of the client team or the Solirius team. Their goal should be to maintain perspective on the project and use their experience to ensure that the technical solution is appropriate. It is the responsibility of the technical team to evaluate and communicate technical options to the broader project. Sometimes we will propose a technical ‘spike’ if additional information is needed.

We worked on the NERIMNET/RREMS Nuclear Monitoring System for BEIS. There were multiple stakeholder organisations with a need for strong (and potentially costly) levels of security and resilience and a stakeholder desire to transform existing business processes.
We deployed business analysts and user researchers to work with stakeholder organisations at the same time as commissioning a technical team to review and propose an initial solution for the rigorous security requirements. These were then balanced against the strategic goals (and time and resource constraints) working with the project team.


Our approach to code development and minimising conflict focuses on clear communication, transparency, clear responsibilities and having a shared common goal with the rest of the team.

Communication and transparency
We make use of sprint ceremonies such as daily stand ups, sprint planning, retrospectives as opportunities to invite all team members. Our approach is open - what we are working on will be visible and open.
We believe open and regular communication with other teams and stakeholders is critical. We discuss planned changes before implementing them and are open to discussion throughout.
We promote pairing between developers from different teams, particularly where there will be some integration or cross-over.
We publish good documentation, and use internal blogs for significant new developments

One team with a shared common goal
We adopt a badge-less ethos and have a history integrating with our client’s existing teams and working practices to deliver results. We feel that the key to avoiding unnecessary conflict is to adopt the right behaviours.
We are open - happy to discuss ideas and consider suggestions and critiques.
Flexible - happy to encompass evolving requirements and respond to business/user needs
Pragmatic - we understand that not every solution is perfect, and we focus on delivery.
Focus on the shared common goal - work on features together to promote a shared sense of ownership.
Adopt a ‘no blame culture’ - help other teams if they need help
Foster a joint team spirit - team socials.
We follow the ten commandments of an egoless programmer

Solirius believes working collaboratively on all elements of delivery, including design and planning, will enable delivery to progress at pace and minimise duplication.

During design workshops our approach is to:
Recognise everyone plays a different role
Determine who’s feedback is needed and when
Think broadly
Narrow the playing field as we iterate
Embrace Feedback.

During planning workshops our approach is to:
Involve a wide audience
Share plans widely
Focus in on the scope and vision for the mission
Identify dependencies
Collaborate

We follow this approach across 3 broad areas of planning activities.
Pre planning - where we understand the business and technical requirement to form the backlog which can be estimated and shared with all dev teams as one single product backlog
Release planning and iteration planning - to manage dependencies and agree the scope of each iteration and release frequency that feeds test plans and engagement plans
Mission Planning - involving all development teams and stakeholders to set the vision and scope for the proceeding mission and identify dependencies.

We underpin these sessions with a sync up meeting to manage and reduce dependencies as each sprint progresses.

We have also used ‘Show and Tell’ to share progress across teams and stakeholders and ‘Show the Thing’ where a team is planning an idea or concept and would like greater involvement from a broader group of people than their own scrum team.
