# Planning Inspectorate

The Planning Inspectorate oversees planning appeals, national infrastructure applications, and local plan examinations across England and Wales. With inspectors operating nationwide, they required a structured way to manage and schedule casework efficiently. Norton Studios was engaged to prototype a solution and assess the feasibility of an in-house system versus a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product.

#### **Problem**

The existing scheduling process lacked automation, making it difficult to efficiently assign casework based on inspector availability, location, and expertise.

#### **Solution**

Norton Studios:

*   Developed and deployed a rapid prototype using Node.js and Nunjucks, leveraging [GOV.UK](http://GOV.UK) frontend libraries.
    
*   Implemented novel algorithms to optimise case scheduling by case age, location, and inspector specialism.
    
*   Integrated with Azure Graph API for automatic calendar scheduling and [GOV.UK](http://GOV.UK) Notify for casework reminders.
    

#### **Impact**

✅ **Improved decision-making** – Provided the Inspectorate with clear insights into the benefits of building vs. buying a scheduling system.  
✅ **Enhanced scheduling efficiency** – Demonstrated how automation could streamline case assignments and reduce administrative overhead.  
✅ **Future-ready approach** – Showed the potential for a fully integrated, data-driven case management system.

The prototype exceeded expectations, highlighting the value of a tailored scheduling solution and influencing the Planning Inspectorate’s long-term technology strategy.
