title: Norton Studios Case Study - Benebox
---

# Benebox

Benebox is a registered charity that provides an easy way for people to donate to a range of charities by saving their change at when making purchases on e-commerce websites.

## Case study

Benebox needed a way to allow their users to quickly and easily donate change from purchases to a charit of their choice.

Norton Studios provided a complete solution from delivery, design and development. We worked closely with Benebox to create a Chrome extension and Next.js website.

We need an innovative solution to detect when users had completed a purchase and then prompt them to donate their change to a charity of their choice.
