# Registers of Scotland

Registers of Scotland (RoS) manages 20 public registers related to land, property, and legal documents, ensuring transparency and efficiency in property transactions and civil registrations. To improve software development processes, RoS sought to modernise its engineering practices and streamline CI/CD workflows.

#### **Problem**

RoS development teams needed better tooling, standardised best practices, and improved CI/CD pipelines to accelerate software delivery while maintaining security and quality.

#### **Solution**

Norton Studios:

*   Coached teams on CI/CD, trunk-based development, and Agile software delivery to improve efficiency.
    
*   Defined engineering standards and best practices, ensuring consistency across projects.
    
*   Developed internal tools using Node.js and TypeScript, enhancing developer productivity and observability with Grafana.
    

#### **Impact**

✅ **Faster, more reliable deployments** – Improved CI/CD pipelines integrated AWS CDK deployment, SonarQube, OSV security scanning, and automated testing.  
✅ **Enhanced developer experience** – Custom internal tools boosted efficiency, reducing manual overhead.  
✅ **Long-term process improvements** – Engineering teams adopted modern best practices, improving collaboration and delivery speed.

By refining RoS’s development processes, Norton Studios helped create a more agile, efficient, and scalable software delivery ecosystem.
