# British Broadcasting Corporation

The BBC is the world's oldest national broadcaster and one of the largest in the world by number of employees. It is a global leader in technology and innovation and has been at the forefront of broadcasting since its inception in 1922.

## Case study

The BBC operate a number of microsites across their digital estate, each with its own unique design and functionality. Over time these sites became difficult to manage, so the BBC sought a more efficient and cost-effective solution.

Norton Studios helped with the delivery of their iSite CMS by providing expertise in JavaScript, Java and PHP. During our time there we delivered a number of key features and dramatically improved the automated regression testing by implementing parallel UI testing with Selenium Grid.
