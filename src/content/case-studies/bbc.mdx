# British Broadcasting Corporation

The BBC is the world's oldest national broadcaster and one of the largest in the world by number of employees. It is a global leader in technology and innovation and has been at the forefront of broadcasting since its inception in 1922.

## **Problem**

The BBC operates a vast network of microsites, each with unique designs and functionalities. Over time, these sites became increasingly difficult to manage, leading to inefficiencies in content updates, maintenance, and deployment. The existing iSite CMS needed improvements to enhance scalability, streamline workflows, and reduce the manual effort required for regression testing.

#### **Solution**

Norton Studios provided technical expertise to enhance the BBC’s iSite CMS, ensuring a more efficient and scalable content management system. Our contributions included:

*   **Feature development** – Implemented key updates to improve site management and content workflows.
    
*   **Automated testing enhancements** – Introduced parallel UI testing with Selenium Grid, dramatically increasing efficiency and reducing testing time.
    
*   **Technical support** – Assisted the BBC’s development teams in refining and optimising iSite for long-term sustainability.
    

#### **Impact**

By improving iSite’s functionality and maintainability, Norton Studios helped the BBC:

✅ **Streamline content management** – Simplified the process of updating and maintaining multiple digital properties.  
✅ **Enhance deployment efficiency** – Reduced manual testing efforts through automation, improving reliability and release cycles.  
✅ **Improve scalability** – Ensured iSite could support the BBC’s evolving digital ecosystem.

Our work helped modernise the BBC’s content management infrastructure, making it more efficient, adaptable, and future-proof.
