## EcoRewards: Turning Sustainable Actions into Real-World Rewards

Encouraging people to adopt sustainable habits is challenging without clear incentives. EcoRewards wanted to build a **seamless reward system** that motivates users to make eco-friendly choices—like recycling, using public transport, and reducing energy consumption. They needed a **scalable, data-driven platform** to track actions, distribute rewards, and engage users effectively.

## **Solution**

We developed a **full-stack solution** to bring EcoRewards to life:

*   **Custom API** built with TypeScript and Node.js to handle user activity, rewards, and data processing.
    
*   **Admin dashboard** in React and TypeScript for managing users, monitoring trends, and optimizing reward distribution.
    
*   **Public website** designed and launched with Jekyll for a fast, accessible user experience.
    
*   **LoRaWAN-powered tracking system** deployed in Bracknell, using TheThingsNetwork to capture real-time sustainability actions.
    

## **Impact**

By combining intuitive design with smart automation, EcoRewards can now:  
✅ **Track real-world sustainable behaviour** with minimal user effort.  
✅ **Engage users through instant rewards** that reinforce eco-friendly habits.  
✅ **Scale their platform efficiently**, supporting more communities and businesses.

EcoRewards transforms good intentions into measurable impact—empowering people to make sustainable choices, one reward at a time.
