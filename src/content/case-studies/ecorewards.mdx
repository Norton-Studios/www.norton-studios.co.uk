# EcoRewards

EcoRewards is a social good platform that rewards users for making sustainable choices. The platform is designed to incentivize users to make eco-friendly decisions by offering rewards for actions such as recycling, using public transportation, and reducing energy consumption. Users can earn points by making green travel choices and can redeem them for rewards such as gift cards, discounts, and donations to environmental causes.
