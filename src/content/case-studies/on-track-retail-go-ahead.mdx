# On Track Retail / Go Ahead

On Track Retail is a joint venture between Go Ahead and Assertis. It was founded to provide an online rail ticketing platform for Go Ahead's rail franchises, including Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern.

## Case study

Go Ahead needed a way to provide a seamless online ticketing experience for their customers. They wanted to offer a platform that was easy to use, fast, and reliable. Norton Studios provided a complete solution from delivery, design, and development. We worked closely with Go Ahead to create a platform that met their needs and exceeded their expectations.

We needed an innovative solution to integrate with the existing rail ticketing systems and provide a seamless experience for customers. We worked closely with Go Ahead to understand their requirements and deliver a platform that met their needs.

All ticketing systems in the UK must pass a rigorous accreditation process with the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) to ensure they meet industry standards.

We helped build the team from the ground up to over 40 engineers, providing expertise in JavaScript, Java, and PHP. We worked closely with Go Ahead to deliver a number of key features and dramatically improve the automated regression testing by implementing parallel UI testing with Selenium Grid.

Architecture, Scala, React built on AWS.
