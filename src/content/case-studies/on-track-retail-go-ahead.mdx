title: Norton Studios Case Study - On Track Retail / Go Ahead

# On Track Retail / Go Ahead

On Track Retail is a joint venture between Go Ahead and Assertis. It was founded to provide an online rail ticketing platform for Go Ahead's rail franchises, including Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern.

## Case study

Go Ahead needed a way to provide a seamless online ticketing experience for their customers. They wanted to offer a platform that was easy to use, fast, and reliable. Norton Studios provided a complete solution from delivery, design, and development. By working closely with Go Ahead, we created an innovative platform which integrated their existing rail ticketing systems, provided a seamless experience for customers, and exceeded the client's expectations.

All ticketing systems in the UK must pass a rigorous accreditation process with the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) to ensure they meet industry standards. By providing our expertise in Javascript, Java, and PHP, we helped build a team of over 40 engineers to meet those standards. Our collaboration with Go Ahead also ensured those standards will continue to be maintanied by dramatically improving automated regression testing and implementing parallel UI testing with Selenium Grid.
